# Client Setup (User)

This guide is for users who want to access the ASA-Database app on the local network.

## 1. Requirements
- Any device with a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
- Connected to the same WiFi or LAN as the host

## 2. How to Connect
1. Ask the host for the server’s IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.10`).
2. Open your web browser.
3. Enter the address: `http://<host-ip>:8000` (e.g., `http://192.168.1.10:8000`).
4. Bookmark the page or create a desktop shortcut for easy access.

## 3. Troubleshooting
- If you can’t connect, check:
  - You are on the same network as the host
  - The host computer is running the app
  - The IP address is correct
  - No firewall is blocking port 8000

## 4. No Installation Needed
- You do NOT need to install anything—just use your browser!
