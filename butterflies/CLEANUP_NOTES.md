# Code Cleanup Notes

## Consolidated Files
The codebase has been cleaned up to remove redundancy and use a single approach:

1. All form definitions are now in `forms.py` (using the organized form layout)
2. All views are now in `views.py` (using the organized template approach)
3. URLs have been updated in `urls.py` to point to the consolidated views

## Removed Files
The following files were redundant and have been removed:
- `forms_organized.py` - functionality moved to `forms.py`
- `views_organized.py` - functionality moved to `views.py`
- `views_consolidated.py` - no longer needed
- `specimen_form_organized.html` - consolidated with `specimen_form.html`
- `_form_organized_new.html` - empty file, no longer needed

## Database Changes
- Date and time fields now use simple CharField storage to avoid complex validation
- Migration files have been created to support these changes

## Template Structure
- All forms now use the organized template layout for better usability
- All form templates (specimen_form.html, locality_form.html, initials_form.html) now use _form_organized.html
- Backward compatibility URLs still exist but now point to the consolidated views

## Next Steps
After confirming everything works correctly, you might want to:
1. Run database migrations: `python manage.py migrate`
2. Test all forms to ensure they work correctly
3. Clean up any unused templates if needed
