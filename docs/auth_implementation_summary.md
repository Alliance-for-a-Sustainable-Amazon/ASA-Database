# Authentication Implementation Summary

## Overview

We have successfully implemented a role-based access control system in the ASA-Database application. The system consists of two main user roles: Admin and Researcher, each with different levels of access to functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. Authentication System
- Added login/logout views using Django's built-in authentication system
- Created login, logout, and access denied templates
- Set up authentication URL patterns
- Added login_required decorator to secure all views
- Created a custom admin_required decorator for sensitive operations

### 2. Permission System
- Created Admin and Researcher user groups with appropriate permissions
- Added management commands to set up groups and test users
- Applied admin_required decorator to delete, import, and locality/initials creation functionality
- Updated templates to conditionally display UI elements based on permissions
- Restricted access to adding new localities and initials to admin users only

### 3. UI Updates
- Added authentication status to the navigation bar
- Conditionally hide delete and import functionality for non-admin users
- Added access denied page

### 4. Documentation
- Created comprehensive authentication documentation
- Updated the project README.md with authentication information

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `/butterflies/templates/butterflies/auth/login.html` - Login template
- `/butterflies/templates/butterflies/auth/logged_out.html` - Logout success template
- `/butterflies/templates/butterflies/auth/access_denied.html` - Access denied template
- `/butterflies/auth_utils.py` - Custom authentication utilities
- `/butterflies/management/commands/setup_groups.py` - Management command to set up user groups
- `/butterflies/management/commands/create_test_users.py` - Management command to create test users
- `/docs/authentication.md` - Authentication documentation

### Modified Files:
- `/research_data_app/urls.py` - Added authentication URLs
- `/research_data_app/settings.py` - Added login settings
- `/butterflies/views.py` - Added authentication decorators
- `/butterflies/templates/butterflies/base.html` - Added authentication UI
- `/butterflies/templates/butterflies/dynamic_list.html` - Conditionally hide admin features
- `/butterflies/templates/butterflies/_detail.html` - Conditionally hide delete button
- `/butterflies/templates/butterflies/_table.html` - Conditionally hide delete links
- `/README.md` - Updated with authentication information

## How It Works

1. **Authentication Flow:**
   - Users must log in at /accounts/login/
   - Once authenticated, they are redirected to the main page
   - Authentication status and role displayed in navigation

2. **Permission Control:**
   - Admin users have full access to all features
   - Researcher users have access to most features except delete and import
   - Permissions enforced both at UI level and server level

3. **User Management:**
   - Users and groups can be managed via Django admin
   - Management commands available for setup and testing

## Next Steps

1. **Testing:**
   - Test all functionality with both admin and researcher accounts
   - Verify that permissions are correctly enforced

2. **Potential Enhancements:**
   - Password reset functionality
   - User profile pages
   - Activity logging
   - More granular permissions

## Best Practices Implemented

- Used Django's built-in authentication system
- Applied the principle of least privilege
- Implemented defense in depth (UI and server-side checks)
- Created comprehensive documentation
- Added management commands for easy setup
